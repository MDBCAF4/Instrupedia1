			  <h2> What are "Drums"? </h2>
			  <p>
			  Drums are a type of percussion instrument that produce sound by striking or hitting a surface, typically a drumhead or membrane, with sticks, mallets, or hands. They are one of the oldest and most essential instruments in many musical traditions, ranging from classical orchestras to modern rock bands, jazz ensembles, and various cultural performances.
